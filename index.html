			<br></br>
            <p>
Hey there! I'm Amber Straka, and my world revolves around three exciting pillars: Lego, NWSL (National Women's Soccer League), and the fascinating realm of data science.

First and foremost, let's talk Lego. I'm not just a casual builder – I'm a full-fledged enthusiast. The joy of transforming those colorful bricks into intricate designs is my kind of therapy. From recreating iconic landmarks to dreaming up fantastical worlds, my Lego creations are a testament to my love for both precision and boundless imagination.

Now, let's kick it up a notch with my passion for the NWSL (Go <a href="https://www.timbers.com/thornsfc/">Portland Thorns</a>!). I'm not your average soccer fan; I'm a dedicated supporter, cheering on my favorite teams and players with unrivaled enthusiasm. Whether I'm in the stands or engaged in lively discussions online, my love for the game goes beyond the pitch, creating a vibrant connection within the NWSL community.

And then, there's my professional side – I'm a data scientist. Numbers, patterns, and problem-solving are my forte. I navigate the intricate landscape of data to derive meaningful insights and make informed decisions. It's not just a job; it's a thrilling journey of discovery and innovation.

In my world, Lego, NWSL, and data science come together to create a unique and dynamic tapestry. Each passion contributes to a rich and fulfilling life, showcasing my ability to find harmony in diverse pursuits. Whether I'm building with Lego bricks, cheering on my favorite soccer teams, or diving into data analytics, I'm on a constant quest for creativity, excitement, and knowledge.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/Astraka1027/SQL/tree/main/Zoo">Zoos and SQL</a></h3>
				<br></br>
                <p>Project Summary:

This project focused on the development of a comprehensive zoo management system using SQL as the primary database management tool. The core components included the creation of a relational database to efficiently store and organize zoo-related data. A key aspect of this project involved the implementation of stored procedures to streamline database operations and enhance overall system performance.

In addition to database creation and optimization, special emphasis was placed on user experience. The project integrated error messaging functionalities for front-end users, ensuring a more intuitive and user-friendly interface. This feature aimed to provide clear feedback to users in the event of data entry errors or system issues, contributing to a smoother and more reliable overall experience.

By combining robust database design with efficient stored procedures and user-centric error messaging, this project laid the foundation for a scalable and user-friendly zoo management system, optimizing data management and enhancing the overall user experience.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/Astraka1027/DataScienceProjects/tree/main/Python/loanAnalysis">Home Loans and Predictive Modeling</a></h3>
				<br></br>
                <p>This project centered on leveraging Python and its key coding libraries, including pandas, numpy, and matplotlib, to conduct a linear regression analysis aimed at predicting loan qualification for applicants. The primary objective was to build a predictive model that could assess an applicant's likelihood of loan approval based on relevant variables.

The utilization of pandas facilitated efficient data manipulation and preprocessing, while numpy enabled mathematical operations critical for the regression analysis. The project also harnessed the visualization capabilities of matplotlib to illustrate key insights and trends in the data.

The culmination of these efforts resulted in a linear regression model with a commendable accuracy score of 0.8067. This score indicated the model's effectiveness in capturing and predicting patterns within the data, providing valuable insights into the factors influencing loan qualification. The high accuracy score underscored the reliability of the model, making it a valuable tool for financial institutions in evaluating loan applications and enhancing decision-making processes.

In essence, this project showcased the power of Python and its libraries in conducting sophisticated data analysis, with a specific focus on building a predictive model for loan qualification, offering a robust tool for financial institutions to streamline their lending processes.</p>
